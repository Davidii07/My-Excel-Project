# My-Excel-Project
This repository contains my excel project,
The dataset is about a company producing different products across different countries with each sales person selling each products.
I used Microsoft Excel to analyze this project,
The process involved when analyzing this project was importing my data into Excel, transforming the data, using pivot table to analyze the data and lastly, visualizing the data.
